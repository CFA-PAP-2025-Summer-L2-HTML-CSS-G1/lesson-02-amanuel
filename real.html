    <h1>Real Chimeras</h1>
    <p>
        In the realm of science, the term chimera has been adopted to describe an organism that contains at least two different sets of origin genetic material. 
    </p>
    <h2>Human chimeras</h2>
    <p>It is extrememly rare, but there are some humans whose bodies contain different sets of DNA. This is most often caused by the fusion of two or more genetically-distinct zygotes (fertilized eggs) into one during gestation.</p>

    <p>Taylor Muhl absorbed her fraternal twin in the womb and as a consequence, has a patch of discolored skin on her abdomen.</p>
    <h2>Human-animal chimeras</h2>
    <p>Scientists hoping to test new medicines or grow human transplant organs in the lab have successfully created humanized mice, rats, pigs, and monkeys. There are strict ethical rules governing this research however, including gestational limits on embryos.</p>
    <h2>Chimeric viruses</h2>
    <P>Using genone editing, scientists researching techniques for the putative preventation and treatment of diseases are able to create chimeric viruses in the laboratory. Perhaps the most well known example of a chimeric virus is SARS-CoV-2, which is the cause of Covid-19.
